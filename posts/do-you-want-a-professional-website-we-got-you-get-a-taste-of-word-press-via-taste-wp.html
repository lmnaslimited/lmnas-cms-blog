</div><div class="markdown-styles_markdown__h_8de"><p><a href="link">TasteWP</a> is reminiscent of the now defunct<a href="link"> poopy.life </a>service. In addition to the unsavory and unforgettable name, poopy.life was laden with obtrusive upgrade ads that floated across the screen periodically. <a href="link">TasteWP</a> takes a different route for promotion and includes three of its plugins pre-installed on the default testing sites.</p>
<p>TasteWP is run by<a href="link"> Inisev</a>, a 15-person company that has been developing WordPress plugins for four years.</p>
<p>The company is planning to enable users to call specific URLs, such as <a href="link">https://tastewp.com?themeslug=slug-of-theme</a>, which would spin up an instance with that theme or plugin already installed. This would allow theme and plugin creators to share the link with their potential users/customers so that they can play around themselves.</p>
<p>Localization is also a high priority for future TasteWP enhancements, since the company is based in Europe where many languages are spoken.</p>

Choosing the right partner for implementing your ERP system is almost as important as selecting the right software in the first place. Let’s see the different portfolio that involves ERP.

Identifying the Company’s needs:**\n\nBefore implementing ERP, you should thoroughly access your company’s needs. Studying critical business processes and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) will help you in identifying the correct enterprise solutions.\n\n**2. Hiring experienced professionals:**\n\nProper guidance to the ERP implementation process is a must. Taking the services of trained professionals will not only make your work easy but also save a lot of precious time. You can thus direct the time you save to other important business tasks.\n\n**3. Selecting the Right Enterprise Application Software:**\n\nWhat’s your industry all about and the needs of your business play a pivotal role in choosing the right ERP solution? Taking the services of an enterprise app development company can be helpful in deciding whether you need a cloud computing ERP system or an on premise ERP system. Because at the end it all boils down to your business needs and capacity.\n\n**4. Data Preparation:**\n\nA proper analysis of the data before entering into the ERP database is a must. After completing the entry part, you can remove the outdated data that’s no longer needed. The key to successful ERP system integration is maintaining the integrity of your business data.\n\n**5. ERP Implementation:**\n\nNow after completing the above steps, it’s the time to launch your ERP system. The ERP consultant will help in chalking out the map to install, configure and optimize the system as per your business needs.\n\n**6. Testing:**\n\nThe ERP solutions have come a long way with time and have become more advanced and efficient. But it isn’t possible to rule out the technical glitches entirely. For smooth implementation and functioning, system and user acceptance testing is a must.\n\n**7. Training:**\n\nProper training of your employees to use the configured enterprise application software is an essential aspect of the implementation process. To make your business grow everyone needs to be up to speed. And the IT team should have a proper rehearsal to handle any technical problem that may crop up now and then.\n\n**8. Activation:**\n\nAfter proper configuration of the enterprise applications and employee training, you can activate your ERP system. And it is always a good recommendation for a mobility service provider to keep a close watch on the working of the ERP system.\n\n**9. Upgrades and Maintenance:**\n\nAny system needs upgrades and maintenance, so is ERP. After installation, it is important to regularly check the ERP system for the latest updates to offer smooth and glitch-free performance.\n\nGet the right Enterprise Application Software!\n\nA successful ERP implementation can do wonders for your business. You can make your company do the talking and make a mark in the competitive market. So, do you wish to implement ERP and get ahead of your competition?
